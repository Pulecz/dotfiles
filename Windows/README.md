# Windwos dotfiles

Purpose of these 3 files:

*  *start_cmd_here.bat* - is to start [cmder](http://cmder.net/) in its current folder

(e.g /c/users/${username}/git)

Make shortcut on desktop to avoid browsing to git folder.

*	*init_bash.bat* - starts bash with ssh_agent.sh, use any bash script you like!

*	*ssh_agent.sh* - starts ssh-agent session (only in that bash instance) and adds github key in /c/users/${username}/.ssh
